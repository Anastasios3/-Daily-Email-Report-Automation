# Daily Email Report Automation

This Python script automates the sending of daily email reports using SMTP. It is designed to be scheduled to run once per day at a predetermined time using a task scheduler like cron on Linux/Mac or Task Scheduler on Windows.

## Features

- Sends a daily email with a predefined subject and body.
- Uses Python's `smtplib` and `email` libraries for creating and sending emails.
- Configurable for any SMTP server.

## Prerequisites

Before running this script, make sure you have:
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Access to an SMTP server (like Gmail, Outlook, etc.) with the ability to use it for sending emails.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/daily-email-report.git
   ```
2. **Configuration**
   - Open `send_email.py` in your favorite text editor.
   - Replace `your_email@example.com`, `your_password`, and `smtp.example.com` with your email, password, and SMTP server details.
   - Update the recipient's email in the `to_email` variable.

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the script manually, execute:

```bash
python send_email.py
```

## Automating the Script

### Windows

Use Task Scheduler to set up a daily task to run the script. Set the action to start a program, specify the path to your Python executable, and add the script's path as an argument.

### Linux/Mac

Set up a cron job by editing your crontab:

```bash
crontab -e
```

Add the following line to schedule the script to run daily at 7 AM:

```
0 7 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/your_script.py
```

## Security Notes

- **DO NOT** hardcode sensitive information like your email password directly in the script. Use environment variables or a secure vault instead.
- Ensure your SMTP credentials are kept secure from unauthorized access.
